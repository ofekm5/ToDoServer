# ToDoServer
A simple Django-based server that manages TODO chors

Guildlines for source code read:
I've created this server using the Django framework, therefore it has the hierarchy of Django.
Meaning(in todo folder):
urls.py=endpoints of the todo app, utils.py=class definition of the todos object, views.py=methods that corrispond to the endpoints
